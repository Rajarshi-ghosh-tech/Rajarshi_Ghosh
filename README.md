As a mechanical engineer, I’ve solved real-world problems with systems and constraints. Google’s Core team builds the backbone of tech I admire—scalable, impactful infrastructure. In 90 days, I’ve taught myself Python, DSA, and distributed systems from scratch to join that mission. I’m not just a coder; I’m a builder with grit.
